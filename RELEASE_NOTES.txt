OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
This KBase service provides helper methods for performing data access, manipulation, analysis,
and visualization of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and phylogenetic trees.  Technical
documentation can be generated in the docs directory by running 'make build-docs'. Deployment
documentation is available in the README.md file.

------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
-This is the first public release of the Phylogenetic Tree Service.
