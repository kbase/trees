OVERVIEW
-----------------------------------------
This KBase service provides helper methods for performing data access, manipulation, analysis,
and visualization of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) and phylogenetic trees.


VERSION: 0.9 (Released 8/5/2013)
------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
- none

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
-general backend code cleanup, improvement
-trivial API changes to conform to new API standards (note, may break old Java clients)
-removed dependency on kb_seed
-improved test coverage


VERSION: 0.04 (Released 4/4/2013)
------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
-abundance profile workflow operates on tables of data (grouping by sample) rather than
requiring iteration over each sample.
-get_tree method supports options to replace node names with a feature id or genome id
even when there is no canonical feature per leaf
-added api method to merge leaves that have zero distance; this method is exposed through
the tree-remove-nodes script.

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
-fixed scripts so that end-to-end abundance profiling workflow can operate in IRIS.


VERSION: 0.03 (Released 2/4/2013)
------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
-added command line scripts that wrap client methods for fetching trees/alignments and
relabeling nodes in trees; command line scripts are wrapped for IRIS deployment/testing

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
-none.

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
-ability to associate nodes with data (e.g. descriptions, abundance values) by mapping node
ids to data in tab-delimited tables
-additional options for tree visualization


VERSION: 0.02 (Released 11/20/2012)
------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
-This is the first public release of the Phylogenetic Tree Service.
-added query methods for tree/alignment retrieval by tree ID, feature ID, protein MD5
-added basic tree label/structure manipulation methods
-added basic tree introspection methods which accept tree structures and returns computed or extracted
properties of the tree structure or select tree nodes
-added basic html visualization method (draw_html_tree)

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
-none.

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
-command line scripts that wrap every client library method and are available through IRIS
-richer set of query methods for retrieiving trees
-ability to associate nodes with data (e.g. descriptions, abundance values) by mapping node
ids to data in tab-delimited tables
-additional options for tree visualization



VERSION: 0.01 (Released 8/16/2012)
------------------------------------------
NEW FEATURES:
-This is the first internal release of the Phylogenetic Tree Service, all methods are new.

UPDATED FEATURES / MAJOR BUG FIXES:
-none.

ANTICIPATED FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
-public release of the service
