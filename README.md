Special deployment instructions
----------
* The Tree service is currently only supported for server deployment in a linux environment.  Only clients and
scripts should be deployed on a Mac.  (to deploy only clients/scripts, use make deploy-client; make deploy-scripts)
* follow the standard KBase deployment and testing procedures


Starting/Stopping the service, and other notes
---------------------------
* to start and stop the service, use the 'start_service' and 'stop_service'
  scripts in /kb/deployment/services/trees
* check /kb/deployment/services/trees/log/error.log to see if there were any errors
* on test machines, tree services listen on port 7047, so this port must be open
* after starting the service, the process id of the serivice is stored in the 
  'service.pid' file in /kb/deployment/services/trees
* log files are currently dumped in the /kb/deployment/services/trees/log
  directory, but this will change once central logging is adopted
* the 'reboot_service' is a quick way to 1) stop a running service if it exists,
  redeploy the implementation libs only and 2) start the service again.  It is
  useful for quick debugging and testing.
