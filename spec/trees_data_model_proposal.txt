This is a working draft of a proposed schema for a CDM extension to support Trees
and Multiple sequence alignments.


Alignment
-alignmentID (will be unique kbase id: 'kb|ali.XXXXX')
-alignment (file/blob)
-nSequences
-metaInfoHash (e.g. name, human readable description, etc)
-timestamp
-isActive (either boolean or for our own reference, a version number)
-alignmentMethod
-alignmentParameters
-alignmentProtocolDescription (human readable, how did you get here with these sequences? could be in a separate table)

AlignmentRowComponent
-alignmentID (needed for efficiency)
-alignmentRow (maybe needed for efficiency)
-alignmentRowID (will be unique kbase id: 'kb|ali.XXXXX.row.XXX')
-concatenationOrder (ordering starting from left to right in alignment row)
-label (text description copied from original fasta file)
-sequenceID (MD5 for protein, probably contigChunk for DNA/RNA)
-isProtein (bool)
-begin
-end

Tree
-treeID (will be a unique kbase id:  e.g. 'kb|tree.XXXX')
-newick (leaf nodes provide a key into the AlignmentRowComponent table)
-alignmentID
-metaInfoHash (e.g. name, human readable description, etc)
-timestamp
-isActive (either boolean or for our own reference, a version number)
-treeGenerationMethod
-treeGenerationParameters
