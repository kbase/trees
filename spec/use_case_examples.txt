USE CASE EXAMPLES FOR THE TREE/MSA API
=========================================


BASIC RETRIEVAL

) get all trees that include a particular gene
) get all trees that include a particular domain
) get all trees that include a particular species
) get an alignment by all the above criteria as well



ANALYSIS

) Given a tree, return a subset of that tree (pertaining to a particular list of species/genes)
) Given a tree and a new sequence, where does the new sequnce map? (add gene to an existing tree)
) Compute evolutionary distance between two nodes in a tree, or return all nodes within a given distance
) draw the tree nicely
) retrieve a tree, substitute annotations of a particular type in the comments of the tree, run SIFTER
) retrieve a tree, map reads to the tree (or given a set of read counts), draw the tree nicely
) create a new tree with a set of given sequences
) diff between two trees (in terms of structures or final positions)
) reconcile multiple trees ???
