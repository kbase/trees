# This script tests the service calls which provide tree introspection methods - which basically means
# that these methods take an input tree (usually) in newick format, and returns some property of the
# tree, such as a list of leaves or the number of nodes.  Most of these methods use a compiled C++
# library on the backend, so this suite of tests also makes sure that this c++ library is functioning properly.
